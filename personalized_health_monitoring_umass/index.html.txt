**** Personalized Health Monitoring ****
This posting will expire on December 31, 2013.
Organization/Institution: University of Massachusetts Amherst
Posted: October 15, 2013
The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of
Massachusetts Amherst (UMass Amherst) invites applications for one or more
tenure-track positions in the field of Personalized Health Monitoring at the
Assistant, Associate and Full Professor levels starting September 2014. We seek
candidates who apply a solid background in computer systems engineering or
electrical engineering to the challenges of personalized health monitoring.

With the founding of the $45 Million Center for Personalized Health Monitoring,
UMass Amherst is catalyzing research to digitize biology. Research aimed at
measuring activity, anatomy, physiology, environmental exposure, blood
chemistry, and pathogen detection are all of interest. Potential technologies
of interest include, but are not limited to, embedded system and software
design, body area networks, wearable electronics, hi-frequency spectroscopy/
imaging and electrochemical sensing.

The Center for Personalized Health Monitoring is part of University and
Commonwealth of Massachusetts initiatives in the Life Sciences which have
provided modern laboratory facilities and opportunities for interdisciplinary
collaboration with researchers from the University of Massachusetts Medical
School, Baystate Medical Center and several Research Institutes and Centers on
campus. These positions are part of a recent call for four Faculty Positions in
Biomedical Engineering at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

Candidates must have an earned doctorate in ECE or related field at the time of
appointment. Successful candidates will be expected to develop a strong
externally funded research program; and must be committed to teaching
undergraduate and graduate courses in computer systems engineering or
electrical engineering. Interest in contributing to the development of a
multidisciplinary biomedical education program is desirable. Rank and salary
will be commensurate with qualifications and experience.
 
*** Application Instructions ***
The search committee will begin reviewing applications on December 2, 2013. The
search will continue until the position is filled (contingent on approval and
funding). We strongly prefer candidates to submit their applications online at
http://umass.interviewexchange.com/jobofferdetails.jsp?JOBID=42655 or http://
umass.interviewexchange.com. If necessary, applications can be mailed to PHM
Search, ECE Department, UMass, Marcus Hall, 100 Natural Resources Road,
Amherst, MA 01003.

The University of Massachusetts Amherst is an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative
Action Employer, promotes diversity, and encourages applications from women and
members of minority groups. The University seeks to increase the diversity of
its professoriate, workforce and undergraduate and graduate student populations
because broad diversity is critical to achieving the University&rsquo;s mission
of excellence in education, research, educational access and service in an
increasingly diverse globalized society. Therefore, in holistically assessing
many qualifications of each applicant of any race or gender we would factor
favorably an individual&rsquo;s record of conduct that includes students and
colleagues with broadly diverse perspectives, experiences and backgrounds in
educational, research or other work activities. Among other qualifications, we
would also factor favorably experience overcoming or helping others overcome
barriers to an academic career or degree.
