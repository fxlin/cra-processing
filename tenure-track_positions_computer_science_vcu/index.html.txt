This posting will expire on December 13, 2013.
Organization/Institution: Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU)
Department: School of Engineering
Posted: October 01, 2013
The Computer Science Department in the School of Engineering at Virginia
Commonwealth University (VCU) invites applications for tenure-track positions
at the rank of Assistant, Associate and Full Professor. Candidates must have a
Ph.D. in computer science or a related area. Junior faculty will be required to
have an established research agenda and a clear potential for external funding,
and potential for scholarship or creative expression to complement and expand
existing expertise in the department and the School of Engineering. At the
Associate and Full Professor levels, the faculty member should have a well-
developed research portfolio with evidence of multidisciplinary applications
and external funding appropriate to complement and expand existing expertise
within the department.
 
Applicants in all areas of computer science will be considered; however,
candidates with research focus on biomedical informatics and big data mining
who are open to conducting interdisciplinary research are of particular
interest. Candidates must desire to actively participate in creating and
nurturing a highly collaborative, creative, innovative, and entrepreneurial
culture. Collaborations are encouraged with other VCU units such as the
nationally top-ranked VCU Medical Center, and Arts and Business Schools.
Successful candidates are expected to teach courses at both the undergraduate
and graduate levels. Additionally, candidates must have demonstrated experience
working in and fostering a diverse faculty, staff, and student environment, or
commitment to do so as a faculty member at VCU.
 
VCU, the largest urban university in Virginia, is a Carnegie-classified very
high research activity university, ranked in the top 100 universities in the
U.S. in federal R&amp;D expenditures. The School of Engineering is in an
extensive growing stage, doubling the number of faculty and improving the
quality of graduate and undergraduate students. Additional information about
the VCU School of Engineering can be found at www.egr.vcu.edu.
*** Application Instructions ***
Review of the applications will continue until suitable candidates are
identified. Candidates are to submit applications tocmscsearch@vcu.eduas a
single PDF file that includes, in order, a cover letter, curriculum vitae,
research and teaching statements, and the names and e-mail addresses of three
references (reference letters should be provided only upon request by the
search committee).
 
Virginia Commonwealth University is an equal opportunity/affirmative action
employer.  Women, minorities, and persons with disabilities are encouraged to
apply.
