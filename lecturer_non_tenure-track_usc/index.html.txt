**** Lecturer, Non tenure-track ****
This posting will expire on January 31, 2014.
Organization/Institution: University of Southern California [USC]
Department: Computer Science Department
Posted: November 26, 2013
The Computer Science Department (http://cs.usc.edu) at the USC Viterbi School
of Engineering (http://viterbi.usc.edu) seeks candidates for teaching positions
(Lecturer) to teach undergraduate and graduate courses. These are full time,
benefits eligible faculty positions on the non-tenure track. Competitive
candidates will have the training and experience necessary to teach effectively
in a highly-ranked Computer Science department that advances undergraduate
students through an accredited BS degree program and graduate students enrolled
in MS and PhD programs. Candidates will have a background (or specific
interest) in one or more of the following areas: Agents, Algorithms, Artificial
Intelligence, Complexity, Databases, Games, Graphics, Information Management,
Multimedia, Natural Language Processing, Networks, Programming, Robotics,
Software Systems and Engineering, Systems, and Vision.

These are primarily teaching positions; all candidates are expected to have a
strong commitment to teaching. Lecturers will spend the majority of their time
on teaching and teaching-related duties with reduced obligation for research
and University service.  Qualified candidates should have a doctoral degree in
Computer Science (or equivalent) by the date of appointment. Salary and
benefits are competitive. While we seek applications at the level of Lecturer,
in exceptional cases, applicants with longer teaching experience may also be
considered for a commensurate position (e.g., Senior Lecturer).
*** Application Instructions ***
Applicants should submit their applications online at:

http://tinyurl.com/USCCSLecturer2014

Applications must include a cover letter, a detailed curriculum vitae, a
teaching statement, and names of at least three professional references, at
least two of whom must be familiar with, and able to comment on, the
applicant&rsquo;s teaching experience. Applicants may also optionally include a
research statement. Applications should be received by January 1, 2014. Later
applications will be considered to the extent possible.

The USC Viterbi School of Engineering is among the top engineering schools in
the world. It counts 177 full-time, tenure-track faculty members, and it is
home to the Information Sciences Institute, two National Science Foundation
Engineering Research Centers, a Department of Energy EFRC (Energy Frontiers
Research Center), and the Department of Homeland Security&rsquo;s first
University Center of Excellence, CREATE.  The school is affiliated with the
Alfred E. Mann Institute for Biomedical Engineering, the Institute for Creative
Technologies and the USC Stevens Center for Innovation.  Research expenditures
typically exceed $180 million annually. With 36 tenure-track faculty, 45
research faculty, and 10 teaching faculty (including a Turing Award winner and
multiple NAE and NAS members), the Department of Computer Science is the
biggest department in the Viterbi School and one of the nation&rsquo;s leading
centers of research and education in the field.  

USC values diversity and is committed to equal opportunity in employment. 
Women and men, and members of all racial and ethnic groups, are encouraged to
apply.
