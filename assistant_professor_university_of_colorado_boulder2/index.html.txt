The Department of Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder seeks
outstanding candidates for a tenure-track position in Cyber-Physical Systems.
The opening is targeted at the level of Assistant Professor, although
outstanding senior candidates at higher ranks may be considered.
We seek candidates whose primary research areas include verification, machine
learning, robotics or embedded systems, and whose research addresses challenges
in application areas such as computational material science, avionics, space
systems, renewable energy, manufacturing, robotics or bio-medical systems.
Candidates should integrate physical systems with relevant computational
techniques, show promise of excellence in both research and teaching, and want
to create and lead a highly visible collaborative research program.
