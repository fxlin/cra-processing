**** Faculty Positions in Computer Science: Experimental Systems and Data
Science ****
This posting will expire on December 31, 2013.
Organization/Institution: University of Rochester
Department: Department of Computer Science
Posted: October 02, 2013
The University of Rochester Department of Computer Science seeks applicants for
multiple tenure track positions in the broad areas of experimental systems and
data science research (including but not exclusively focused on very large
data-driven systems, machine learning and/or optimization, networks and
distributed systems, operating systems,  sustainable systems, security, and
cloud computing). Candidates must have a PhD in computer science or a related
discipline.
 
*** Application Instructions ***
Apply online at:

https://www.rochester.edu/fort/csc

Consideration of applications at any rank will begin immediately and continue
until all interview slots are filled.  Candidates should apply no later than
January 1, 2014 for full consideration. Applications that arrive after this
date incur a probability of being overlooked or arriving after the interview
schedule is filled up.  

The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (http://
www.ece.rochester.edu/about/jobs.html) is also searching for a candidate
broadly oriented toward data science. While the two searches are concurrent and
plan to coordinate, candidates should apply to the department/s that best
matches their academic background and interests.

The Department of Computer Science is a research-oriented department with a
distinguished history of contributions in systems, theory, artificial
intelligence, and HCI. We have a collaborative culture and strong ties to
electrical and computer engineering, cognitive science, linguistics, and
several departments in the medical center. Over the past decade, a third of the
department's PhD graduates have won tenure-track faculty positions, and its
alumni include leaders at major research laboratories such as Google,
Microsoft, and IBM.

The University of Rochester is a private, Tier I research institution located
in western New York State. It consistently ranks among the top 30 institutions,
both public and private, in federal funding for research and development. The
university has made substantial investments in computing infrastructure through
the Center for Integrated Research Computing (CIRC) and the Health Sciences
Center for Computational Innovation (HSCCI). Teaching loads are light and
classes are small. Half of all undergraduates go on to post-graduate or
professional education. The university includes the Eastman School of Music, a
premiere music conservatory, and the University of Rochester Medical Center, a
major medical school, research center, and hospital system. The greater
Rochester area is home to over a million people, including 80,000 students who
attend its 8 colleges and universities.

The University of Rochester has a strong commitment to diversity and actively
encourages applications from candidates from groups underrepresented in higher
education. The University is an Equal Opportunity Employer.
