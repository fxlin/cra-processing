This posting will expire on December 16, 2013.
Organization/Institution: Texas A&M University
Department: Department of Computer Science and Engineering
Posted: September 20, 2013
The Dwight Look College of Engineering at Texas A&amp;M University invites
nominations and applications for the position of head of the Department of
Computer Science and Engineering.

In response to the national demand for more qualified engineers, the Look
College has embarked on &ldquo;25 by 25,&rdquo; an ambitious enrollment growth
initiative to more than double the college&rsquo;s current enrollment to 25,000
engineering students by the year 2025. The Department of Computer Science and
Engineering will be an integral part of this planned growth. We seek a dynamic,
innovative candidate who can lead the growth in students, faculty, and staff
that is envisioned. We are looking for an innovative thinker with a strategic
vision for guiding the department to a higher level of excellence that can
communicate this vision to a constituency that includes academia, government,
industry, and alumni. Candidates should possess proven leadership and
administrative skills, and an established reputation as a scholar consistent
with an appointment to the rank of professor of computer science and
engineering with tenure. Candidates must have a Ph.D. in computer science,
computer engineering, or a related field.

The Department of Computer Science and Engineering has 36 tenured and tenure-
track faculty members and three full-time lecturers. The department currently
has faculty with a number of national distinctions, including National Academy
of Engineering membership, ACM and IEEE Fellows, and ACM Distinguished
Scientists and Engineers. The department has a strong and vibrant research
program, with 47 percent of the faculty receiving NSF CAREER/NYI/PYI awards.
The department offers bachelor&rsquo;s, master&rsquo;s, and Ph.D. degrees in
computer science and &mdash; jointly with the Department of Electrical and
Computer Engineering &mdash; in computer engineering, to roughly 275 graduate
and 830 undergraduate students. In recent years, the department has built a
strong national reputation based on the quality of its faculty and programs;
among public institutions, its graduate computer engineering program ranks 12th
and its graduate computer science 27th in the most recent U.S. News &amp; World
Report rankings. More information about the department is available at http://
www.cse.tamu.edu.

Texas A&amp;M, a land-grant, sea-grant, and space-grant institution, is one of
the six largest universities in the United States and has more than 50,000
students. Today, the Dwight Look College of Engineering is one of the largest
and best endowed in the nation, and it ranks among the top institutions in
every significant national poll, including sixth for graduate programs and
eighth for undergraduate programs among public institutions by U.S. News &amp;
World Report. The Look College has long enjoyed national leadership status in
engineering education, and currently has more than 11,000 engineering students
in 13 departments. Approximately 25 percent of the engineering students are
graduate students.

 
*** Application Instructions ***
Letters of application should include:
(1) a full curriculum vitae,
(2) a two-page statement summarizing the candidate&rsquo;s vision and goals for
the department and leadership philosophy, and
(3) the names and addresses of at least five references.

Applications will be accepted until the position is filled; screening will
begin immediately. Nominations or applications should be sent to
headsearch@cse.tamu.edu.
