This posting will expire on January 31, 2014.
Organization/Institution: The University of Arizona

Applications are invited for a tenure-track faculty position in the general
area of large-scale, data-centric computing (&quot;Big Data&quot;). The
research areas of distributed systems, storage and database systems,
information visualization, machine learning and data mining, security and
privacy, bioinformatics, and scalable storage are especially desirable.
Outstanding candidates in related areas will also be considered. The ideal

scientific disciplines. Our preference is to hire at the Assistant Professor
level, but we will consider outstanding applications at all ranks.

The Department of Computer Science at the University of Arizona has a long
history of research accomplishment, influential software distribution, and
substantial external funding. Major funding has included four NSF
infrastructure grants.
