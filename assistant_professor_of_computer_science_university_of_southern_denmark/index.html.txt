**** Assistant Professor of Computer Science ****
This posting will expire on December 01, 2013.
Organization/Institution: University of Southern Denmark, Odense - http://
www.sdu.dk/en/stillinger
Department: The Department of Mathematics and Computer Science (IMADA)
Posted: October 02, 2013
The Department of Mathematics and Computer Science (IMADA) at the University of
Southern Denmark, Odense, invites applications for a position as assistant
professor of computer science. The appointment is expected to take effect 1
April 2014, or shortly thereafter, and last for three years. After successful
completion of a lecturer training programme and a successful performance
evaluation, a position for associate professor is normally opened, for which
the assistant professor can apply.

The successful applicant is expected to have a well documented record of
research in one of the areas of distributed systems, database systems, or
analysis and implementation of programming languages, though other areas may
also be considered, in particular if they can be aligned with the goal of
building competences in the area of embedded, mobile, and/or distributed
computing.

In addition to research, the applicant is expected to contribute to teaching
and advising in computer science at all levels (undergraduate through PhD) and
to be able to teach in a broad range of core computer science areas at the
undergraduate level.

Fluency in English is required for this position. Knowledge of Danish is not a
prerequisite for application. More English than Danish is used in teaching in
computer science, and about half of the faculty members in computer science are
foreigners.
*** Application Instructions ***
Deadline for applications: 1 December 2013
