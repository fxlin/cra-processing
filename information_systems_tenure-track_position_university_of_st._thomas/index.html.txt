The Department of Computer and Information Sciences (http://www.stthomas.edu/

The department consists of 9 full-time faculty members and offers

includes lower-division courses for non-majors and lower- and upper-division
courses for majors.

Established in 1885, the University of St. Thomas is located in the major
metropolitan area of Minneapolis-St. Paul, and is Minnesota&rsquo;s largest
private university. Its 10,000 students pursue degrees in a wide range of
liberal arts, professional, and graduate programs.

Inspired by Catholic intellectual tradition, the University of St. Thomas
educates students to be morally responsible leaders who think critically, act
wisely, and work skillfully to advance the common good, and seeks to develop
individuals who combine career competency with cultural awareness and
intellectual curiosity. The successful candidate will possess a commitment to
the ideals of this mission.

The University of St. Thomas has a strong commitment to the principles of
diversity and inclusion, to equal opportunity policies and practices, and to
the principles and goals of affirmative action. In that spirit, the University
welcomes nominations and applications from a broad and diverse applicant pool.

Applicants should have outstanding teaching skills, an active research agenda,
and a willingness to contribute to the work of the department and the
university. In particular, applicants must have an excellent background in the
area of systems analysis and design. Successful candidates will also have
expertise in one or more of the following areas: web development, accounting
information systems, E-commerce, and/or technology project management. A PhD in
Information Systems or closely related area is preferred, but ABDs (with
appointment at the rank of instructor until proof of PhD is supplied) will be
considered.
