**** Tenure-Track Assistant Professorships ****
This posting will expire on December 31, 2013.
Organization/Institution: Harvey Mudd College
Department: Computer Science Department
Posted: October 02, 2013
The Computer Science Department at Harvey Mudd College (HMC) has two tenure-
track openings for assistant professors commencing July 1, 2014. HMC is a
highly selective undergraduate liberal arts college (770 students) emphasizing
science, mathematics, and engineering. HMC is part of the Claremont consortium,
which includes five colleges and two graduate schools.

Candidates in all areas of computer science will be considered. Applicants
should provide evidence of both excellence in teaching and interest in engaging
with undergraduate students in research and industry-sponsored projects. The
candidate must be committed to recruiting, teaching, and retaining a broadly
diverse student body including, but not limited to, African Americans,
Southeast Asian Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, Pacific
Islanders, women, persons with disabilities, and other groups underrepresented
in computer science. Candidates from these groups are especially encouraged to
apply. All candidates are invited to describe explicitly the nature of their
commitment and experience with underrepresented groups.

The Department of Computer Science currently has ten permanent faculty members
and serves three major programs (the computer science major, a joint major in
computer science and mathematics, and a second joint major in mathematical and
computational biology) with a total of more than eighty students in each
graduating class.

Among the department's strengths are its success in recruiting women (who
comprise 30% of our faculty and 40% of our majors) to computer science, an
innovative and rigorous curriculum that prepares students for both employment
and graduate school, and an active research program that involves a substantial
number of undergraduates. Most classes are relatively small. The teaching load
is four courses per year on the semester system and supervision of up to two
industry-supported yearlong senior capstone Computer Science Clinic projects.
Please visit http://www.cs.hmc.edu for more information about the department
and the Clinic program.
*** Application Instructions ***
Applicants should apply with a cover letter describing their interest in
teaching specifically at Harvey Mudd College, a curriculum vita, a statement
regarding teaching philosophy and experience, any supporting materials such as
teaching evaluations, and a statement of research interests. Concurrently,
please request three references to submit letters via using the secure web-
based system https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/jobs/3190. It is desirable that
at least one letter address the candidate's potential as a teacher.
Applications received by December 15, 2013 will receive full consideration.
Questions about the position can addressed to Professor Robert M. Keller, at
cssearch@cs.hmc.edu.

Harvey Mudd College is an Equal Opportunity Employer and is committed to the
recruitment of candidates traditionally underrepresented on college faculties.
