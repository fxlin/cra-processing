**** Multiple Faculty Positions ****
This posting will expire on January 31, 2014.
Organization/Institution: Texas A&M University
Department: Department of Computer Science and Engineering
Posted: November 19, 2013
TheDepartment of Computer Science and Engineering of the Dwight Look College of
Engineering at Texas A&amp;M University invites applicationsfor multiple
faculty positions, including tenured or tenure-track positions, non-tenure
track teaching-focused positions, and department head, starting fall 2014.
Additionally, a number of multi-disciplinary centers and institutes are seeking
faculty that may have interests aligned with computer science or computer
engineering.
In response to the national demand for more qualified engineers, the Look
College has embarked on &ldquo;25 by 25,&rdquo; an ambitious enrollment growth
initiative to more than double the college&rsquo;s current enrollment to 25,000
engineering students by the year 2025. The Department of Computer Science and
Engineering will be an integral part of this planned growth. The department
currently has 36 tenured and tenure‐track faculty members and three full‐time
lecturers. The department has faculty with a number of national distinctions,
including National Academy of Engineering membership, ACM and IEEE Fellows, and
ACM Distinguished Scientists and Engineers. The department has a strong and
vibrant research program, with half the faculty receiving NSF CAREER/NYI/PYI
awards. More information about the department is available at http://
www.cse.tamu.edu.
 
*** Application Instructions ***
Open Rank Position in Computer Science or Engineering. The department invites
applications for an assistant, associate or full professor in the areas of (1)
big data, including large-scale data management/analytics and information
visualization, (2) natural language processing, and (3) software, including
programming languages and software engineering. Exceptional candidates in other
areas are also welcome to apply.
Senior Faculty Position in Computational Science: In recognition of the
increasing importance of computational sciences, the University has identified
this area as a target for growth. As part of an expansion in this area, the
Department of Computer Science and Engineering is recruiting for a full
professor in computational science. This position will have freedom to define a
research agenda both by making use of the considerable available startup and by
leveraging the significant existing resources at the Institute for Applied
Mathematics and Computational Science (http://iamcs.tamu.edu).
Teaching-focused Positions. The department invites applications for lecturers,
senior lecturers, instructional professors, including assistant and associate
ranks, and associate and full professors of engineering practice. These
positions are primarily focused on teaching. Instructional professors have an
expectation of scholarly activity in engineering education. Professors of
engineering practice are typically individuals who have extensive experience in
the workplace that they can bring to the classroom.
Application_Process
Candidates for the above assistant, associate or full professor positions must
have a Ph.D. in computer science, computer engineering, or related field and
will be expected to teach, perform research, and supervise graduate students.
Candidates for the lecturer or instructional professor track positions should
also have a Ph.D. in computer science, computer engineering or a related field,
while candidates for the professor of engineering practice track positions are
expected to have at least a bachelors degree and extensive experience in the
field. For questions about the positions, contact: search@cse.tamu.edu.
Applications should include a curriculum vitae, statement of teaching and
research interests, and at least three references and should be submitted
online at http://apply2.cse.tamu.edu/.
Department Head. Nominations and applications are invited for the position of
head of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. We seek a dynamic,
innovative candidate who can lead the growth in students, faculty, and staff
that is envisioned. We are looking for an innovative thinker with a strategic
vision for guiding the department to a higher level of excellence that can
communicate this vision to a constituency that includes academia, government,
industry, and alumni. Candidates should possess proven leadership and
administrative skills, and an established reputation as a scholar consistent
with an appointment to the rank of professor of computer science and
engineering with tenure. Candidates must have a Ph.D. in computer science,
computer engineering, or a related field. Nominations or applications should be
sent to headsearch@cse.tamu.edu; applications should include a full curriculum
vitae, a two-page statement summarizing the candidate&rsquo;s vision and goals
for the department and leadership philosophy, and the names and addresses of at
least five references.
Additional Multi-Disciplinary Positions
The recently established Center for Remote Health Care Technology (CRHCT)
invite applications for multidisciplinary tenured/tenure track faculty at the
assistant, associate and full professor ranks in the area of remote health,
including next-generation remote medical information systems and innovative
engineering of remote medical devices. Applications should include a curriculum
vitae and a list of three references and be submitted to
centerfacultysearch@tamu.edu.
The interdisciplinaryInstitute for Digital Humanities, Media, and Culture
(IDHMC)is inviting applications for an assistant, associate or full professor
with an established record in digital humanities research and/or humanities,
artistic, or information visualization. Potential research specializations
include digital humanities within a humanities discipline; computational
linguistics and corpus linguistics; data-mining and/or natural language
processing; artistic, information, and scientific visualization; library,
archival, and information science; media studies and communication; physical
computing/tangible computing; and human-computer interaction. Applications
should include a letter of interest, current curriculum vitae, and list of
references an should be submitted to idhmc@tamu.edu.
