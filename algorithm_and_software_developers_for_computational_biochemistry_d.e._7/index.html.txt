**** Algorithm and Software Developers for Computational Biochemistry ****
This posting will expire on January 03, 2014.
Organization/Institution: D. E. Shaw Research
Posted: October 28, 2013
Extraordinarily gifted computational scientists and engineers are sought to
join a New York&ndash;based interdisciplinary research group pursuing an
ambitious, long-term project aimed at achieving major scientific advances in
the field of biochemistry and fundamentally transforming the process of drug
discovery.  
 
Candidates should have a demonstrated track record of academic, industrial,
and/or open-source accomplishments.  Relevant areas of expertise might include
parallel computing on high performance computing systems employing multi-core,
GPU, or special-purpose architectures, numerical analysis, C/C++, or Python
programming, data-intensive computing, compilers, operating systems, or
distributed systems, but specific knowledge of and level of experience in any
of these areas is less critical than exceptional intellectual ability.  We are
prepared to reward exceptionally well-qualified individuals with above-market
compensation.  
 
Among the group&rsquo;s current research activities is the development of new
algorithms and software for molecular dynamics simulation and data analysis
both on commodity clusters and on Anton, a massively parallel special-purpose
supercomputer of our group&rsquo;s design.  Successful candidates will have the
opportunity to work closely with a number of the world&rsquo;s leading
computational chemists and biologists, and to make fundamental contributions
within the fields of biology, chemistry, and medicine.
