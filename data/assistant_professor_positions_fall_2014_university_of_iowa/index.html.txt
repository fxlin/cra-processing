initiative is intended to strengthen expertise and infrastructure in
informatics, more specifically, data analytics, systems software, machine
learning, theory and algorithms, embedded systems, networks and smart sensors,
computer graphics and visualization as well as areas that bridge core
informatics to other disciplines. Areas of particular interest in this first

visualization, and iii) device and network centric software. Applications
received by January 1, 2014, are assured of full consideration.

Education Requirement: Candidates must hold a PhD in computer science,
informatics, or a closely related discipline. Appointments will be made within
the Computer Science Department, which offers BA, BS, MCS, and PhD degrees in
computer science, and BA and BS degrees in Informatics.

Required Qualifications: Duties include conducting externally funded research
in the candidate's area of expertise, teaching undergraduate and graduate
computer science and/or informatics courses, supervising graduate student
research, and making service contributions to the Department, the College, the
University, and the discipline. Successful candidates must demonstrate
potential for research and teaching excellence in the environment of a major
research university, and will be expected to participate in collaborative
research as part of the interdisciplinary informatics initiative.

Desirable Qualifications: Demonstrated interest in solving interdisciplinary
problems, the ability to work with interdisciplinary teams, and prior teaching
experience.
