located in Greenwich Village, one of the most attractive residential areas of
Manhattan.

The department has 35 regular faculty members and several clinical, research,
adjunct, and visiting faculty members. The department's current research
interests include algorithms, cryptography and theory; computational biology;
distributed computing and networking; graphics, vision and multimedia; machine
learning; natural language processing; scientific computing; and verification
and programming languages.

Collaborative research with industry is facilitated by geographic proximity to
computer science activities at AT&amp;T, Google, IBM, Bell Labs, NEC, and
Siemens.
