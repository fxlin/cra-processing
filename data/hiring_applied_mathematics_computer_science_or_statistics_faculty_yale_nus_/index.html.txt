**** Hiring Applied Mathematics, Computer Science, or Statistics Faculty ****
This posting will expire on January 10, 2014.
Organization/Institution: Yale-NUS College
Department: Division of Science
Posted: October 30, 2013
The newly established Yale-NUS College (www.yale-nus.edu.sg) in Singapore, a
collaboration between the National University of Singapore (NUS) and Yale
University, seeks to hire two faculty members in any area of Applied
Mathematics, Computer Science, or Statistics.  The search is open with regard
to rank.  We are particularly interested in candidates who combine an active
research agenda with interest in a collegiate liberal arts environment and a
demonstrated commitment to creative and effective undergraduate teaching and
mentoring.

Yale-NUS College seeks outstanding teacher-scholars, who are committed to
innovative pedagogy and curriculum development, who are active researchers, and
who enjoy closely mentoring students.  Regardless of their field of
specialization, candidates should be enthusiastic about contributing to an
interdisciplinary common curriculum in the liberal arts.  

Salary, benefits, and leave policies will be competitive at an international
level.  The College expects further rounds of hiring over the next few years as
the student body increases.  Yale-NUS College is committed to supporting
faculty research through generous startup grants, annual research and travel
budgets, and sabbatical leave.

For all general inquiries, please contact yale-nus.college@yale.edu.  Review of
applications will begin November 15th, 2013, and continue until the positions
are filled.
*** Application Instructions ***
The College values diversity and is committed to equality of opportunity. For
