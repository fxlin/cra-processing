**** Tenure-Track Position ****
This posting will expire on January 31, 2014.
Organization/Institution: Shanghai Jiao Tong University
Department: Department of Computer Science and Engineering
Posted: November 28, 2013
The Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at Shanghai Jiao Tong
University (SJTU) is seeking to fill several tenure-track positions in computer
science at the rank of Assistant Professor and above, starting January 2014 and
September 2014.
Shanghai Jiao Tong University is one of the oldest and most prestigious
universities in China, and CSE is premier in computer science research and
education. Candidates for these positions are sought for the well-recognized
computer science program (ACM class) at Zhiyuan College of SJTU which provides
an outstanding undergraduate education to a select group of 30 research-
oriented students. Over the last ten years, students from the ACM class have
won five gold medals in the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest.
Professor John Hopcroft, 1986 Turing Award recipient, is chairing the committee
on curriculum development and faculty recruiting. Since December 2011, he has
spent two months a year teaching at Zhiyuan College. In May 2012, he was
appointed Special Counselor to President Jie Zhang.
An internationally competitive package for salary and benefits will be offered.
Strong candidates in all areas will be considered with special consideration
given to systems and networking, architecture, machine learning, theory, and
security. In addition to the teaching duties at Zhiyuan College&rsquo;s ACM
class, faculty members are required to teach graduate level courses, to
supervise Ph.D. students, and to conduct research in the CSE. The overall
teaching load is one course per semester.
SJTU makes a great effort to provide opportunities for the development of young
faculty, including a startup research grant. There are a number of sources for
additional research funding. The positions are provided in strong cooperation
with Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA) with opportunities for research
collaborations. Candidates are encouraged to apply to the Thousand Talents
Program for extra funding and benefit support. Our equal opportunity and
affirmative action program seek minorities, women, and non-Chinese scientists.
The criteria for promotion will be professional reputation as judged by
international experts in the candidate&rsquo;s field and excellence in
teaching.
 
*** Application Instructions ***
Applications, including vita and the names of three references, should be sent
to Professor John Hopcroft (jeh@cs.cornell.edu) and to Bing Li
(binglisjtu@sjtu.edu.cn).
The application deadline is January 31, 2014 for positions starting in
September 2014. Applications for starting earlier will be reviewed immediately.
