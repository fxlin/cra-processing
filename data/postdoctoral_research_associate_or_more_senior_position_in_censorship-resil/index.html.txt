**** Postdoctoral Research Associate or More Senior position in censorship-
resilient systems ****
This posting will expire on December 31, 2013.
Organization/Institution: Princeton University
Department: Electrical Engineering
Posted: October 24, 2013
The Department of Electrical Engineering has an opening for a postdoctoral
researcher with interest in researching censorship-resilient systems, working
under Prof. Prateek Mittal and Prof. Mung Chiang. They are interested in
researchers with strengths in communication networks, distributed systems,
social networks, security and privacy; prior experience in anti-censorship
technologies is a plus but not required. They are particularly interested in
researchers who are interested in &quot;bridging the gap&quot; between theory
and practice by exploring fundamental underpinnings to build real systems with
strong properties.

Appointments will be for one year with the possibility of renewal pending
satisfactory performance and funding availability. Applicants should have a
Ph.D. at the time of the appointment in Electrical Engineering, Computer
Science or related areas. Princeton University is an equal opportunity employer
and complies with applicable EEO and affirmative action regulations.
*** Application Instructions ***
Applications must be submitted online at https://jobs.princeton.edu to job
requisition #1300771.  Please include a CV, statement of research and contact
