**** Assistant Professor ****
This posting will expire on December 31, 2013.
Organization/Institution: University of Kentucky
Department: Computer Science Department
Posted: October 08, 2013
The University of Kentucky Computer Science Department expects to hire an
Assistant Professor to begin employment in August of 2014. Candidates must have
earned a PhD in Computer Science or closely related field at the time
employment begins. Applications are now being accepted. Review of credentials
will begin immediately and continue until the position is filled.
The department seeks to hire energetic researcher/educators who are interested
in the application of advanced computing to challenging and relevant problems.
Our faculty undertake interdisciplinary research, working with other
departments including statistics, biology, linguistics, electrical engineering,
computer engineering, and the humanities. We therefore favor researchers who
can collaborate to solve problems involving multiple disciplines. All areas of
computing will be considered, but a focus area related to software systems, big
data, multimedia and/or imaging is preferred. These areas tie to our
department's Laboratory for Advanced Networking, Center for Visualization and
Virtual Environments, and Software Engineering. It is possible that the right
candidate could be eligible for a named professorship at this level.
*** Application Instructions ***
To apply, a University of Kentucky Academic Profile must be submitted at
ukjobs.uky.edu/applicants/Central?quickFind=245523.
For more detailed information about this position, go to www.cs.uky.edu/
opportunities/faculty.
The University of Kentucky is an equal opportunity employer and especially
encourages applications from minorities and women.
