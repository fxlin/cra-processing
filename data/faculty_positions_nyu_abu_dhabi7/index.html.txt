This posting will expire on December 31, 2013.
Organization/Institution: NYU ABU DHABI
Department: Computer Science
Posted: October 09, 2013
NYU Abu Dhabi is looking for outstanding tenured or tenure-track faculty in all
areas of Computer Science. Two particular focus areas this year are:
1. Human-Computer Interfaces. We are specifically looking for researchers who
build new user interface systems and technologies in any of the following
research areas: physical and pervasive computing, multimedia, accessibility,
graphics, and vision. Candidates are encouraged to submit links to videos and
other online resources showing devices and systems they have already built in
action. Projects already in progress at NYU Abu Dhabi include music and rhythm
analysis, haptic devices, 3D printing of embedded optical elements for
interactive devices, and emotion-sensitive interfaces.
2. Networks and Distributed Systems. We are specifically looking for
researchers with strong experience in building and deploying large-scale
networked systems in the real world. Specific sub-areas of interest include
cloud computing, wireless and mobile systems, high performance computing, and
systems security.
In describing their teaching experience, candidates should identify courses
they could teach both within and outside their specialty.
Successful candidates will find a congenial research environment that includes
supportive and highly motivated colleagues, access to significant resources, a
competitive startup package, and broad opportunities for interdisciplinary
research across the different global campuses of NYU. Successful candidates
will also have priority access to NYU Abu Dhabi High Performance Computing
facilities, including the new Butinah cluster with more than 6400 computing
cores and a peak performance of 70 TFLOPS.
New York University has established itself as a Global Network University, a
multi- site, organically connected network encompassing key global cities and
idea capitals. The network has three foundational, degree-granting campuses:
New York, Abu Dhabi, and Shanghai, complemented by a network of over 15
research and study-away sites across five continents. Faculty and students will
circulate within this global network in pursuit of common research interests,
and the promotion of cross-cultural and interdisciplinary solutions for
problems, both local and global.
Entering its fourth year, NYU Abu Dhabi has recruited a cohort of faculty who
are distinguished in their research and teaching. Our students are drawn from
around the world and surpass all traditional recruitment benchmarks, both in
the US and globally. NYU Abu Dhabi&rsquo;s highly selective liberal arts
enterprise is complemented by an institute for advanced research, sponsoring
cutting-edge projects across the arts, humanities, social sciences, sciences,
and engineering.
The terms of employment are highly competitive and include housing and
educational subsidies for children. Faculty may also spend time at NYU New York
and other sites of the global network, engaging in both research and teaching
opportunities. Appointments can begin as soon as September 1, 2014, but
candidates may elect to start as late as September 1, 2015. 
*** Application Instructions ***
Review of applications will begin November 18, 2013. Candidates should submit a
curriculum vitae, statements of teaching and research interests (not to exceed
three pages each), no more than three representative publications and three
letters of reference in PDF format to be considered by November 15, 2013.
Please visit our website at http://nyuad.nyu.edu/about/careers/faculty-
positions.html for instructions and other information on how to apply. If you
have any questions, please e-mail nyuad.science@nyu.edu.
NYU Abu Dhabi is an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Employer.
