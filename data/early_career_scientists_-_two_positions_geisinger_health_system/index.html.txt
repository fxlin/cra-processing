**** Early Career Scientists - Two Positions ****
This posting will expire on December 31, 2013.
Organization/Institution: Geisinger Health System Neurosciences Institute
Posted: October 29, 2013
Geisinger Health System&rsquo;s Neurosciences Institute is seeking creative,
innovative thinking, early career scientists for two positions:

•    Machine Learning &amp; Computational Intelligence Investigator
•    Applied Mathematics and Predictive Analytics Investigator

Both positions will work under the direction of Dr. Nicholas Marko, a Clinical
Neurosurgeon and Data Scientist, in the newly developed Mathematical and
Computational Neurosciences Research Group.  This group is closely affiliated
with Geisinger&rsquo;s Center for High Performance Medical Computing, which Dr.
Marko is also the co-director. This is an excellent and rare opportunity to for
investigators interested in applied research to use state-of-the-art methods in
mathematics, computational intelligence, and data modeling to address real-
world problems in clinical medicine.
*** Application Instructions ***
If interested in either of these positions, please send CV &amp; statement of
research interest to: Dr. Nicholas Marko, MD, Director of the Mathematical
&amp; Computational Neurosciences Research Group/Co-Director, Center for High-
Performance Medical Computing, c/o Jocelyn Heid, Manager, Professional Staffing
at jheid1@geisinger.edu.
