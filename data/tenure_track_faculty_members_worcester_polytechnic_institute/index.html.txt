**** Tenure Track Faculty Members ****
This posting will expire on December 20, 2013.
Organization/Institution: Worcester Polytechnic Institute
Posted: October 01, 2013
Balance. Research &amp; Teaching, Theory &amp; Practice, Innovation &amp;
Fundamentals, Classes &amp; Projects.  Balance defines life at WPI. If you are
that unique individual who strives for and achieves it, consider joining the
faculty at WPI.

The Computer Science Department anticipates hiring one or more tenure track
faculty for the Fall of 2014 whose expertise is in the following areas:

Computer Security including network, system, or software security, forensics
and usable security; Data Sciences including databases, data mining, big data
analytics and working with different application domains; Bioinformatics
working in a cross-disciplinary program with faculty from Biology and
Mathematics; Serious Games working with faculty in our Interactive Media &amp;
Game Development as well as our Learning Sciences &amp; Technologies
interdisciplinary programs; and Algorithms, particularly with connections to
previously listed areas.

In addition to these specific areas, outstanding candidates in any area will
receive full consideration. Candidates should have a PhD in Computer Science or
a closely related field, and the potential for excellence in research and
teaching.

Founded in 1865, WPI is one of the nation's first technological universities. A
highly selective private university located within an hour of Boston, WPI is
consistently ranked among the top 60 research institutions by US News &amp;
World Report. The university is home to an innovative and intensive project-
based curriculum that empowers students with the knowledge and skills to
address real world problems around the globe, an approach repeatedly cited for
excellence by The Fiske Guide to Colleges and The Princeton Review.

Located in the heart of New England, WPI is surrounded by cultural and
recreational opportunities.  The UMass Medical Center, a large number of
technology companies and many colleges and universities are located in the
immediate area making it ideal for two-career families.
