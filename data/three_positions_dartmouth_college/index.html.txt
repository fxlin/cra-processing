**** Three Positions ****
This posting will expire on December 31, 2013.
Organization/Institution: Dartmouth College
Department: Department of Computer Science
Posted: October 21, 2013
Assistant Professor of Computer Science: Computer Graphics/Digital Arts

The Dartmouth College Department of Computer Science invites applications for a
tenure-track faculty position at the level of assistant professor. We seek
candidates who will be excellent researchers and teachers in the areas of
computer graphics and/or digital arts, although outstanding candidates in any
area will be considered. We particularly seek candidates who will be integral
members of the Digital Arts program and help lead, initiate, and participate in
collaborative research projects both within Computer Science and involving
other Dartmouth researchers, including those in other Arts &amp; Sciences
departments, Dartmouth&rsquo;s Geisel School of Medicine, and Thayer School of
Engineering.

The department is home to 17 tenured and tenure-track faculty members and two
research faculty members.  Research areas of the department encompass the areas
of systems, security, vision, digital arts, algorithms, theory, robotics, and
computational biology. The Computer Science department is in the School of Arts
&amp; Sciences, and it has strong Ph.D. and M.S. programs and outstanding
undergraduate majors.  Digital Arts at Dartmouth is an interdisciplinary
program housed in the Computer Science department, working with several other
departments, including Studio Art, Theater, and Film and Media Studies.  The
department is affiliated with Dartmouth's M.D.-Ph.D. program and has strong
collaborations with Dartmouth's other schools.

Dartmouth College, a member of the Ivy League, is located in Hanover, New
Hampshire (on the Vermont border). Dartmouth has a beautiful, historic campus,
located in a scenic area on the Connecticut River. Recreational opportunities
abound in all four seasons.  With an even distribution of male and female
students and over one third of the undergraduate student population members of
minority groups, Dartmouth is committed to diversity and encourages
applications from women and minorities.

To create an atmosphere supportive of research, Dartmouth offers new faculty
members grants for research-related expenses, a quarter of sabbatical leave for
each three academic years in residence, and flexible scheduling of teaching
responsibilities.

Applicants are invited to submit application materials via Interfolio at http:/
/apply.interfolio.com/23489.  Upload a CV, research statement, and teaching
statement, and request at least four references to upload letters of
recommendation, at least one of which should comment on teaching. Email
facsearch14@cs.dartmouth.edu with any questions.

Application review will begin November 1, 2013, and continue until the position
is filled.
