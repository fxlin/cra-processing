The Department of Computer Science (CS) at the University of Colorado Boulder
seeks outstanding candidates, for a tenure-track position, with expertise in
both machine learning and optimization. The opening is targeted at the level of
Assistant Professor, although exceptional senior candidates at higher ranks may
be considered.

We seek candidates whose primary research areas lie at the intersection of
machine learning and numerical optimization, and whose research addresses
challenges in theory, algorithms, implementation, and application of problems
in optimization and machine learning. Candidates should demonstrate excellence
in both research and teaching, have a strong interest in interdisciplinary
collaboration, and aim to lead a highly visible, externally funded research
program.
