Posted: September 25, 2013
The Decision Sciences area at INSEAD invites applications for faculty positions
(all ranks). We invite applicants from top engineering and business schools
with research interest in areas that include, but not limited to, data
analytics, risk management, decision analysis, pricing and revenue management.
Interested candidates should send a cv, research statement, representative
papers, and three recommendation letters by e-mail to Cécile GIRARDON
&ldquo;cecile.girardon@insead.edu&rdquo;.

INSEAD is a top-ranked international business school with campuses in France,
Singapore, and Abu Dhabi, and offers salaries and benefits competitive with top
US business schools.  Research excellence is an essential criterion for hiring
and promotion at INSEAD.  Candidates for junior level appointments must
demonstrate the potential for original research leading to publications in top
academic journals.  Candidates for associate or higher level appointments
should have an established record of research excellence, as evidenced by
publications in top academic journals.  The typical teaching load at INSEAD is
comparable to other top US business schools. Course topics include, but not
limited to, applied statistics, data analytics, decision modelling, and risk
management.
