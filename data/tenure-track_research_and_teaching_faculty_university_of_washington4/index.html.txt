**** Tenure-Track, Research, and Teaching Faculty ****
This posting will expire on December 31, 2013.
Organization/Institution: University of Washington
Department: Computer Science & Engineering
Posted: October 16, 2013
The University of Washington's Department of Computer Science &amp; Engineering
has one or more open positions in a wide variety of technical areas in both
Computer Science and Computer Engineering, and at all professional levels. A
moderate teaching load allows time for quality research and close involvement
with students.  Our space in the Paul G. Allen Center for Computer Science
&amp; Engineering provides opportunities for new projects and initiatives. The
Seattle area is particularly attractive given the presence of significant
industrial research laboratories as well as a vibrant technology- driven
entrepreneurial community that further enhances the intellectual atmosphere.
Information about the department can be found on the web at http://
www.cs.washington.edu.

We welcome applicants in all research areas in Computer Science and Computer
Engineering including both core and inter-disciplinary areas.  We expect
candidates to have a strong commitment both to research and to teaching.  We
are primarily focused on hires at the Assistant or Associate professorial ranks
although individuals at senior ranks with exceptional credentials may be
considered..  We also may be seeking full-time non-tenured research faculty at
Research Assistant, Associate and Professor levels, and full-time postdoctoral
researchers (Research Associates).  Applicants for both tenure-track and
research positions must have earned a doctorate, or foreign equivalent, by the
date of appointment.  All University of Washington faculty engage in teaching,
research and service.

We also are seeking one or more part-time or full-time Lecturers and Sr.
Lecturers.  Applicants for lecturer positions must have earned at least a
Master's degree or have relevant teaching experience in the course area.
Lecturers and Sr. Lecturers will be hired on an annual or multi-annual
appointment.

 
*** Application Instructions ***
Please apply online at https://norfolk.cs.washington.edu/apply with a letter of
application, a complete curriculum vitae, statement of research and teaching
interests, and the names of four references.  Applications received by December
1, 2013 will be given priority consideration.  Open positions are contingent on
funding.

The University of Washington was awarded an Alfred P. Sloan Award for Faculty
Career Flexibility in 2006.  In addition, the University of Washington is a
recipient of a National Science Foundation ADVANCE Institutional Transformation
Award to increase the participation of women in academic science and
engineering careers.  We are building a culturally diverse faculty and
encourage applications from women and minority candidates.  The University of
Washington is an affirmative action, equal opportunity employer.
