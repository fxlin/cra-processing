**** Faculty Positions in Science, Technology, and Innovation ****
This posting will expire on December 31, 2013.
Organization/Institution: Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology, Moscow,
Russia
Posted: October 21, 2013
The new Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology (Skoltech) in Moscow seeks
candidates in science and technology for tenured and tenure-track positions to
begin early 2014 or thereafter.

Established in collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
(MIT), Skoltech integrates strong foundational graduate educational programs
and cutting-edge basic and applied research with an ecology of innovation and
entrepreneurship to establish a new model for advancing knowledge, developing
technology, and creating economic value to improve the Russian Federation and
our world.

We encourage applications for positions in and across Skoltech&rsquo;s five
technical focus themes, as well as in cross-cutting areas and in innovation and
entrepreneurship. Applications in Skoltech priority areas listed below are of
particular interest, but strong candidates in all areas of science and
technology related to major themes are encouraged to apply.

•    Information Science and Technology (priority areas in software): machine
learning and artificial intelligence, systems and networks, big data-related
areas, electronic materials and devices,quantum technology, photonics
•    Biomedical Science and Technology (priority areas): computational and
systems biology, immunology and infectious disease, gene- and nano-medicine,
regenerative medicine, neuroscience, translational medicine
•    Energy Science and Technology (priority areas): hydrocarbon fuel
production and transportation,hydrocarbon processing,electric power systems
generation and distribution,electrical energy storage,energy efficient
systems,energy and the environment
•    Space Science and Technology (priority areas): supporting humans in long
term space exploration, design and construction of small satellites,
utilization of space data for communications, positioning, and earth system
information collection, lunar and planetary engineering and science, safety
engineering, propulsion
•    Nuclear Science and Technology (priority areas): nuclear energy safety,
materials for extreme environments, non-energy applications of nuclear and
radiation technologies, human and biological radiation effects
•    Cross-cutting Areas: advanced materials (in particular, composite
materials), computational and data-intensive science and engineering, human
factors engineering
•    Entrepreneurship and Innovation (including commercialization, product
design/development, manufacturing, large scale systems). For additional
details, see the separate listing for &ldquo;Faculty Positions in Technological
Innovation and Entrepreneurship&rdquo; at www.skoltech.ru/faculty.

Faculty will lead the development of a new curriculum and innovative research
structure, with the opportunity to spend their first year at MIT to develop
classroom materials and launch new research collaborations.  Teaching and
research will be carried out in the English language.  Internationally
competitive salary and benefits, startup packages, and opportunities for
substantial research funding will be provided.
