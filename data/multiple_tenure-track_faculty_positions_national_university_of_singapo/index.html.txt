**** Multiple Tenure-Track Faculty Positions ****
This posting will expire on December 31, 2013.
Organization/Institution: National University of Singapore
Department: Department of Computer Science
Posted: October 02, 2013
The Department of Computer Science, National University of Singapore (NUS), has
openings for several tenure-track faculty positions. Our main focus is on
candidates at the Assistant Professor level with research interests in the
following areas:

•    Cyber-physical systems
•    Big data analytics
•    Security
•    Sensor data modelling and learning

These areas are to be viewed in a broad sense, and we are particularly
interested in candidates whose research interests cut across these and related
areas. We seek candidates demonstrating excellent research potential and a
strong commitment to teaching. We will also seriously consider exceptional
candidates in other areas of computer science. Further, we will consider
candidates at senior ranks (Associate and Full Professor) who have an
outstanding record of research accomplishments.

We are an internationally top-ranked department with low teaching loads,
excellent facilities, and intensive external collaborations. Significant
funding opportunities abound for strong candidates. The research of the faculty
covers all the major areas of computer science and is well represented at
prestigious international conferences and journals. The department has a
thriving PhD programme and it actively strives to attract the best students
from the region and beyond. More information can be found at http://
www.comp.nus.edu.sg/.

NUS offers highly competitive salaries and generous benefits, while Singapore
provides a vibrant international environment with world-class health care,
excellent infrastructure, a warm climate and low taxes.
