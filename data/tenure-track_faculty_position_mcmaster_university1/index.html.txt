**** Tenure-Track Faculty Position ****
This posting will expire on January 03, 2014.
Organization/Institution: McMaster University
Posted: October 29, 2013
Ranked among the top engineering schools in Canada and worldwide, the Faculty
of Engineering plays a key role in helping McMaster University earn its well-
deserved reputation as one of Canada&rsquo;s most innovative universities in
learning and research.

The McMaster Faculty of Engineering has a reputation for innovative programs,
cutting-edge research, leading faculty, and aspiring students. It has earned a
strong reputation as a centre for academic excellence and innovation. The
Faculty has approximately 150 faculty members, along with close to 4,000
undergraduate and 750 graduate students.

The Department of Computing and Software at McMaster University seeks
outstanding candidates for a tenure-track faculty position. The appointment is
intended to be at the Assistant or Associate Professor level.  Applicants with
a doctorate in Computer Science or Software Engineering (or a related area) at
the time of appointment are encouraged to apply.  The Department invites
applications from exceptional candidates in all areas, including those with
expertise in: big data, cyber-physical systems, digital media and human-
computer interaction, high performance computing, mobile computing,
optimization, and systems.

The potential to develop a strong research program and become an excellent
teacher is crucial.  Successful candidates will be expected to attract external
research funding, pursue industrial collaboration if appropriate, actively
recruit and supervise graduate students, and teach at both the undergraduate
and graduate levels.  Registration or eligibility for registration by the
Professional Engineers of Ontario will be considered an asset.
*** Application Instructions ***
Salary and rank are commensurate with experience and qualifications. 
Applications, including a CV, a statement detailing teaching and research
interests, and the names of at least three referees should be sent

Applications review will begin immediately and the appointment will ideally
commence July 1, 2014. However, applications will be accepted until the
position is filled.

Note: All qualified candidates are encouraged to apply. However, Canadian
citizens and permanent residents will be considered first for these positions.
McMaster University is strongly committed to employment equity within its
community, and to recruiting a diverse faculty and staff. The University
encourages applications from all qualified candidates, including women, members
of visible minorities, Aboriginal peoples, members of sexual minorities and
persons with disabilities.
