**** Open-Rank Tenured or Tenure-Track Faculty Position ****
This posting will expire on December 31, 2013.
Organization/Institution: University of Washington, Seattle Campus
Department: Department of Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) and Department
of Statistics (Stat)
Posted: October 16, 2013
The Provost of the University of Washington has launched a major effort focused
on Data-Driven Discovery, with a commitment to hire several new faculty in this
area.  In support of this effort, we are seeking candidates for one open-rank
tenured or tenure-track faculty position jointly in the Department of Computer
Science &amp; Engineering and the Department of Statistics at the University of
Washington. This position will be a full-time joint appointment in both
departments with precise percentages as appropriate for the candidate.  The new
faculty will also participate in the UW eScience Institute.  

We encourage applications from exceptional candidates at the intersection of
computer science and statistics, with a particular focus on machine learning
and large-scale statistical analysis.  We expect candidates to have a strong
commitment to both research and teaching.  The joint position will be primarily
focused on hires at the Assistant Professor or Associate Professor levels
although individuals at senior ranks with exceptional credentials may be
considered.  Applicants must have earned a PhD, or foreign equivalent, by the
date of appointment.  All University of Washington faculty engage in teaching,
research and service.

The CSE and Stat departments are located less than 5 minutes apart on the
Seattle campus, enabling cross department collaborations and initiatives.  The
Seattle area is particularly attractive given the presence of significant
industrial research laboratories, a vibrant technology-driven entrepreneurial
community, and spectacular natural beauty.
 
*** Application Instructions ***
Please apply online at https://statcse.cs.washington.edu/apply  with a letter
of application, a complete curriculum vitae, a statement of research and
teaching interests, and the names of at least four references. The review of
applications will start on November 15, 2013, and those received by January 15,
2014, will be given priority consideration.  Open positions are contingent on
funding.

The University of Washington was awarded an Alfred P. Sloan Award for Faculty
Career Flexibility in 2006.  In addition, the University of Washington is a
recipient of a National Science Foundation ADVANCE Institutional Transformation
Award to increase the participation of women in academic science and
engineering careers.  We are building a culturally diverse faculty and
encourage applications from women and minority candidates. The University of
Washington is an affirmative action, equal opportunity employer.
