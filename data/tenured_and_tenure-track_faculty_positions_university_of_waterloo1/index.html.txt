**** Tenured and Tenure-Track Faculty Positions ****
This posting will expire on January 31, 2014.
Organization/Institution: University of Waterloo
Department: David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science
Posted: October 30, 2013
Applications are invited for several tenure-track or tenured faculty positions
in the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science.

(a) One senior tenured David R. Cheriton Chair in Software Systems is open for
candidates with outstanding research records in software systems (very broadly
defined). The successful applicant will be an acknowledged leader in his or her
field or have demonstrated the potential to become such a leader. This position
includes substantial research support and a teaching reduction.

(b) Several tenure-track positions are open for candidates who will enhance the
school's strength in any area of computer science.  We are open to making more
senior appointments should the circumstances warrant. Successful applicants who
join the University of Waterloo are expected to be leaders in research, engage
actively in graduate-student supervision, and contribute to the overall
development of the School.  A Ph.D. in Computer Science, or equivalent, is
required, with evidence of excellence in teaching and research.  Rank and
salary will be commensurate with experience, and appointments are expected to
commence during the 2014 calendar year.
 
With 80 faculty members, the University of Waterloo's David R. Cheriton School
of Computer Science is the largest in Canada. It enjoys an excellent reputation
in pure and applied research and houses a diverse research program of
international stature. Because of its recognized capabilities, the School
attracts exceptionally well-qualified students at both undergraduate and
graduate levels. In addition, the University has an enlightened intellectual
property policy which vests all rights in the inventor. Please see our web site
for more information: http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca.
*** Application Instructions ***
To submit an application, please register at the submission site: http://
www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/faculty-recruiting. Once registered, instructions will be
provided regarding how to submit your application.  Applications will be
considered when they are complete and as long as positions are available.

November 30, 2013.
