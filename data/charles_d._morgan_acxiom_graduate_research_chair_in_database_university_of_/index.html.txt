This posting will expire on December 31, 2013.

Department: Department of Computer Science and Computer Engineering
Posted: October 15, 2013
The Department of Computer Science and Computer Engineering at the University
of Arkansas invites applications from outstanding individuals for the Charles
D. Morgan/Acxiom Graduate Research Chair in Database at the rank of Professor.
This is an endowed chair that provides significant funds to supplement
externally funded research. Areas of interest include, but are not limited to,
emerging areas of research in big data such as infrastructure and management,
search and mining, and security and trust. The successful candidate should
possess a PhD in Computer Science, Computer Engineering or closely related
field, an established record of scholarship, external funding, and evidence of
leadership.

The CSCE department offers BS, MS, and PhD degrees in Computer Science and
Computer Engineering to approximately 400 undergraduate and 60 graduate
students. The department has fifteen faculty with annual external research
funding of $1.8 million and is housed within a new 90,000 sq. ft. building. For
more information concerning the department see http://www.csce.uark.edu.

The University of Arkansas has invested over $450 million on new, expanded, and
modernized facilities since 2011. Since 2008 campus enrollment has increased by
more than 6,000 students with an additional 160 new faculty being added to
support both research and teaching missions. The U.S. News &amp; World Report
identified the University of Arkansas as one of the country&rsquo;s nine up-
and-coming public universities and the Chronicle of Higher Education listed the
University as one of the best in the country in which to work.
