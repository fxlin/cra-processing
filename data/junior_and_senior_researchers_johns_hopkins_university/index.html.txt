**** Junior and Senior Researchers ****
This posting will expire on February 28, 2014.
Organization/Institution: Johns Hopkins University
Department: Human Language Technology Center of Excellence
Posted: October 21, 2013
The Human Language Technology Center of Excellence (COE) at Johns Hopkins
University seeks to hire outstanding junior and senior researchers in all areas
of speech and language processing.  Positions include research scientist and
post-doc.

The COE, located near Johns Hopkins&rsquo; beautiful Homewood campus in
Baltimore, Maryland, conducts long-term research on fundamental challenges that
are critical for real-world problems.  Its researchers publish widely.

Applicants must hold a Ph.D in computer science, linguistics, electrical
engineering, or a closely related field.

Candidates should have a strong background in one or more of these areas:
•    Natural Language Processing and Understanding: Information extraction,
knowledge distillation, semantics, sentiment, parsing, morphology, including
low-resource languages
•    Machine Translation: Low-resource languages, large-scale training, phrase-
based and syntax-based approaches
•    Speech Processing: Robust speech recognition and speaker identification
(multiple languages, genres, and channels, limited resources), speech
retrieval, language identification
•    Machine Learning: Large-scale learning, transfer learning, semi-supervised
learning, data mining

Research Scientists
Research scientist positions carry many of the same benefits and
responsibilities as faculty positions. Scientists are charged with setting the
agenda for a research program, working with other members of the HLTCOE
research team to pursue the organization&rsquo;s cutting edge research goals,
publishing research results in academic venues, advising students, and
(optionally) teaching University courses.

Senior applicants: A senior applicant should be an experienced researcher with
a track record of high quality publications, and should also have significant
experience in project management and a demonstrated ability in building HLT
systems.  Senior applicants should have experience equivalent to the level of
associate professor. Applications will be considered on a rolling basis.

Junior applicants: Junior applicants should have a strong record of
publication, and demonstrated research experience. Applicants should have
experience equivalent to those applying to assistant professor positions.
Submit applications by January 3, 2014 for full consideration; however,
applications will be accepted until positions have been filled.
Post-Docs
Recent PhD graduates may apply for postdoctoral positions, which last from 1-
2 years. Applicants will be supervised by research scientists.

Note: U.S. Citizenship and security clearance are required for most positions;
the COE will seek a clearance for those who do not already have one.
