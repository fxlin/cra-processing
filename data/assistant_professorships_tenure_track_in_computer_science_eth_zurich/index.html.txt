**** Assistant Professorships (Tenure Track) in Computer Science ****
This posting will expire on December 31, 2013.
Organization/Institution: ETH Zurich
Posted: October 02, 2013
The Department of Computer Science (www.inf.ethz.ch) at ETH Zurich invites
applications for assistant professorships (Tenure Track) in the areas of:

-    Computer Systems
-    Software Engineering
-    Information Systems (with emphasis on Big Data)

For candidates with exceptional research accomplishments also applications for
a full professorship will be considered.

The department offers a stimulating and well-supported research and teaching
environment. Collaboration in research and teaching is expected both within the
department and with other groups of ETH Zurich and related institutions.

Applicants should have internationally recognized expertise in their field and
pursue research at the forefront of Computer Science. Successful candidates
should establish and lead a strong research program. They will be expected to
supervise Ph.D. students and teach both undergraduate level courses (in German
or English) and graduate level courses (in English).

Assistant professorships have been established to promote the careers of
younger scientists. The initial appointment is for four years with the
possibility of renewal for an additional two-year period and promotion to a
permanent position.
*** Application Instructions ***
Please apply online at www.facultyaffairs.ethz.ch

Applications should include a curriculum vitae, a list of publications, a
statement of research and teaching interests and the names of at least three
referees. The letter of application should be addressed to the President of ETH
Zurich, Prof. Dr. Ralph Eichler. The closing date for applications is 15
January 2014. ETH Zurich is an equal opportunity and family friendly employer
and is further responsive to the needs of dual career couples. In order to
increase the number of women in leading academic positions, we specifically
encourage women to apply.
