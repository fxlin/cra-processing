**** Open Rank Faculty Position ****
This posting will expire on January 31, 2014.
Organization/Institution: University of Virginia
Department: Department of Computer Science - School of Engineering and Applied
Science
Posted: November 07, 2013
Two hundred years ago, Thomas Jefferson founded the University of Virginia with
a vision &quot;to advance the knowledge and well-being of mankind, not
infinitely, as some have said, but indefinitely.&quot; The Department of
Computer Science seeks to fill one or more tenure-track faculty positions to
help us continue this mission. We are interested in candidates from all areas
and at all levels of seniority. We are primarily interested in the originality
and potential impact of your ideas, as well as your capability and inclination
to make the world a better place.
UVa is located in Charlottesville, Virginia. Situated in the beautiful
foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains and in close proximity to Washington, DC,
Charlottesville consistently ranks among the top cities to live and work. The
University is a Carnegie Research I University and includes a top-ranked
medical school, graduate business school, and law school. UVa is consistently
ranked as a top public university. The University of Virginia is an equal
opportunity/affirmative action employer.
The Department of Computer Science is housed in the new, six-story Rice Hall,
which serves as the nexus for research in high-performance computing, wireless
health, cyber-physical systems, bioinformatics, graphics, security,
dependability, cryptography, software engineering, machine learning, and
computer vision. Our faculty is comprised of twenty-four active members
committed to Jefferson's vision. Our faculty includes fellows of various
professional societies, many NSF CAREER award recipients, a Microsoft New
Faculty Award Winner, and a Packard Fellow. The University, our location, and
our faculty provide a vibrant intellectual environment for research and
education in computing and related disciplines.
We expect our faculty members to seek external funding to support their
research, to teach at the graduate and undergraduate levels, and to provide
service to the Department, the University, and professional organizations.
Candidates must hold a Ph.D. in computer science or a related discipline.
We will begin reading applications on December 15, 2013. Our review will
continue until the position is filled.
