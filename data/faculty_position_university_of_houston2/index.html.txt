**** Faculty Position ****
This posting will expire on December 31, 2013.
Organization/Institution: University of Houston
Department: Department of Computer Science
Posted: October 21, 2013
The Department of Computer Science at the University of Houston (www.cs.uh.edu)
invites applications for multiple tenure-track faculty positions at all levels
starting in Fall 2014. The Department is in a phase of significant growth in
enrollments, sponsored research, and faculty size. The current search is
focused on the following research areas: Computer and Information Security,
Software Design, Human Computer Interaction, Bioinformatics and Theory.
However, outstanding candidates in other areas will be considered. Applicants
should hold a doctoral degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, or a
closely related field.

The Department places a strong emphasis on research and the Ph.D. program with
world- renowned research groups in Computer Systems (cyber-physical systems,
high performance computing, networks, real-time systems, security), Data
Analytics (big-data analysis, data mining, database systems, information
retrieval, machine learning, natural language processing), Computational Life
Sciences (biomedical image analysis, biometrics, medical robotics), and Visual
Computing (graphics, gaming, visualization). The Department&rsquo;s research
combines advances in core computer science areas with pace-setting multi-
disciplinary programs in computational medicine, biology, and psychology. The
combination of fundamental research and innovations has led to numerous local,
national and international collaborations, the strongest of which are with the
Texas Medical Center and the Houston energy industry.

The University of Houston, one of the largest in the nation with approximately
40,000 students, is located in one of the most vibrant metropolitan areas. It
was recently classified as a Tier-One university with very high research
activity by the Carnegie Foundation and is listed as one of the nation&rsquo;s
best institutions for undergraduate education by the Princeton Review. Houston,
the 4th largest U.S. city, is the epicenter of the energy industry, features
the largest medical center in the world, and hosts the Johnson Space Center.
The Department&rsquo;s research laboratories have joint programs with
laboratories from the local medical schools and hospitals, NASA, and the local
high-tech industry.

 
*** Application Instructions ***
Applicants should submit their Curriculum Vitae, research and teaching
statements, and up to two representative publications. Junior candidates should
arrange for at least three professional references while senior candidates
should provide at least five. More information and instructions are available
on-line at:

The University of Houston is an equal opportunity/affirmative action employer. 
Minorities, women, veterans, and persons with disabilities are encouraged to
