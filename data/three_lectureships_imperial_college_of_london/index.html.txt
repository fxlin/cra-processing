UK, and is a world leader in academic research in Computer Science. Its
research has been ranked 2nd in the UK in the Research Assessment Exercise
undertaken by the Higher Education funding Council for England in 2008. The
Complete University Guide ranks the department&rsquo;s teaching as second in
Computer Science.

You will have a PhD or equivalent in a relevant field. You should be able to
demonstrate an ability to establish independent research and you will be
