**** Faculty Positions Available in the Department of Computer Science ****
This posting will expire on December 31, 2013.
Organization/Institution: Virginia Tech
Department: The Department of Computer Science
Posted: October 03, 2013
The Department of Computer Science at Virginia Tech (www.cs.vt.edu) seeks
applicants for tenure-track junior faculty positions in four areas: machine
learning, algorithms, human-computer interaction, and software engineering/
programming languages. Candidates should have a PhD in Computer Science or
related field at the time of appointment, a record of scholarship and
collaboration in computing and interdisciplinary areas, demonstrated ability to
contribute to teaching at the undergraduate and graduate levels, the skills to
establish and grow a successful research group, and sensitivity to issues of
diversity in the campus community. Selected candidates are expected to travel
occasionally to attend professional conferences/meetings.

Assistant Professor in Machine Learning: Full-time tenure-track position, at
the rank of Assistant Professor, for outstanding candidates with expertise in
machine learning and an interest in tackling real problems in the context of
multidisciplinary collaborations in the Discovery Analytics Center
(dac.cs.vt.edu). There also are rich opportunities in a highly collaborative
department with strengths in HCI, high performance and scientific computing,
computational biology and bioinformatics, information retrieval, software
engineering, CyberArts, and CS education. Research on security and personal
health informatics is possible in collaboration with the VT-Carilion Research
Institute associated with the VT-Carilion School of Medicine. See
www.cs.vt.edu/FacultySearch for additional information on how to apply online.
Inquiries should be directed to Dr. Adrian Sandu, Search Committee Chair,
sandu@cs.vt.edu.

Assistant Professor in Algorithms:  Full-time tenure-track position, at the
rank of Assistant Professor, for outstanding candidates in theoretical computer
science, specifically with research focus in discrete algorithms. It is
desirable that the candidate have the ability to develop synergistic
collaborations with established research areas such as computational biology
and bioinformatics, cyber security, and data mining. See www.cs.vt.edu/
FacultySearch for additional information on how to apply online. Inquiries
should be directed to Dr. Lenny Heath, Search Committee Chair, heath@vt.edu.

Assistant Professor in Human-Computer Interaction: Full-time tenure-track
position, at the rank of Assistant Professor, for outstanding candidates with
expertise in HCI.  The department is especially interested in candidates in
sub-areas of HCI involving human interaction with big data or advanced
technologies, such as large-scale data visualization and/or human-robot
interaction. Nevertheless, candidates from all areas of HCI are encouraged to
apply. Candidates will have opportunities for collaboration in the
interdisciplinary Center for Human-Computer Interaction (hci.vt.edu), a
university-wide effort that brings together faculty with strengths in multi-
sensory interactive communication, ecologies of displays and devices, social/
collaborative computing, and human aspects of data/information/ knowledge. See
www.cs.vt.edu/FacultySearch for additional information on how to apply online.
Inquiries should be directed to Dr. Doug Bowman, Search Committee Chair,
bowman@vt.edu.

Assistant Professor in Software Engineering/Programming Languages: Full-time
tenure-track position, at the rank of Assistant Professor, for outstanding
candidates with research breadth across several areas of software engineering
and/or programming languages (e.g., mobile applications, Web-based software,
testing, program analysis, domain specific languages, dynamic languages). See
www.cs.vt.edu/FacultySearch for additional information on how to apply online.
Inquiries should be directed to Dr. Cal Ribbens, Search Committee Chair,
ribbens@vt.edu.

The Department of Computer Science has 36 research oriented tenure-track
faculty and 11 research faculty. There are a total 12 NSF/DOE CAREER awards in
the department. Research expenditures during FY2013 were $11.7 million; total
research funding at the beginning of FY2014 was $34 million. BS, MS, and PhD
degrees are offered, with an enrollment of over 550 undergraduate majors (12%
women) and over 200 PhD/MS students. In 2010, CS@VT was ranked 5th in the
country in recruiting quality of CS undergrads by the Wall Street Journal. The
department is in the College of Engineering, whose undergraduate program was
ranked 6th and graduate program was ranked 12th among public engineering
schools in 2013 by U.S. News &amp; World Report.

Applicant screening will begin on December 15, 2013 and continue until each
position is filled.  We welcome applications from women or minorities.  Salary
for suitably qualified applicants is competitive and commensurate with
experience. Selected candidates must pass a criminal background check prior to
employment.

Virginia Tech is an equal opportunity/affirmative action institution.
