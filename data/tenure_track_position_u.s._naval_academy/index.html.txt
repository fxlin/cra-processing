**** Tenure Track Position ****
This posting will expire on December 13, 2013.
Organization/Institution: U.S. Naval Academy
Department: Computer Science Department
Posted: September 30, 2013
The U.S. Naval Academy&rsquo;s Computer Science Department invites applications
for a tenure track position at the rank of Assistant Professor. This position
is anticipated to begin in August 2014.  A Ph.D. in Computer Science or closely
related field is required.

The Computer Science Department offers majors in Computer Science and
Information Technology, and contributes to a new interdisciplinary major in
Cyber Operations. We currently have 100 CS majors, 70 IT majors and a faculty
of 18.  In addition to courses for CS, IT, and Cyber Operations majors, we also
teach a course on cyber security to the entire freshman class.

Applicants must have a dedication to teaching, broad teaching interests, and a
strong research program. Applications are encouraged from all areas of
computing research.

The department is housed in a state of the art building overlooking the scenic
Severn River. Our spaces provide outstanding office, laboratory, and research
facilities for both students and faculty, including specialized labs for
information assurance, networking, and robotics, as well as three micro-
computing labs and two high performance computing labs.

The Naval Academy is an undergraduate institution located in historic downtown
Annapolis, Maryland on the Chesapeake Bay.  Roughly half of the faculty are
tenured or tenure track civilian professors with Ph.D.s who balance teaching
excellence with internationally recognized research programs.  The remaining
faculty are active duty military officers with Masters or Doctoral degrees. 
Each year the academy graduates roughly 1000 undergraduate students with majors
in the sciences, engineering, and humanities.  More information about the
department and the Academy can be found at http://www.usna.edu/cs/ and http://
www.usna.edu/.
*** Application Instructions ***
Applicants should send a cover letter, teaching and research statements,
curriculum vitae, and arrange for three letters of recommendation that address
both teaching and research abilities to be sent to cssearch@usna.edu. Where
possible, applicants are encouraged to include information that elaborates on
the strength of their research program (such as conference acceptance rates or
research awards).

Review of applications will begin immediately and will continue until the
position is filled; apply by December 1, 2013 to ensure full consideration.

The United States Naval Academy is an Equal Opportunity Employer.
