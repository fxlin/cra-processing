Share your expertise and interact with fellow computer science faculty at the
annual AP® Reading
Cincinnati, OH • June 2014
For more than 50 years, AP® has partnered with high school AP teachers and
faculty at colleges/universities to prepare students for success in higher
education. By participating in the AP Reading, college-level faculty and high
school teachers help ensure that AP exams continue to measure a student&rsquo;s
ability to master college-level work. This year we are especially looking for
expertise in Computer Science.
Join more than 11,000 college faculty and experienced AP teachers who convene
annually to score free-response questions from students around the world.
You&rsquo;ll receive an honorarium and reimbursement for travel expenses,
lodging and meals.
