**** Multiple Faculty Positions ****
This posting will expire on January 31, 2014.
Organization/Institution: University of Illinois at Chicago
Department: Computer Science Department
Posted: October 24, 2013
The Computer Science Department at the University of Illinois at Chicago
invites applications for multiple tenure-track positions in Computer Systems,
broadly defined, at the rank of Assistant Professor. Exceptional candidates at
other ranks may also be considered. Candidates in related areas whose research
evidences a strong empirical focus are also encouraged to apply.

The University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) ranks among the nation&rsquo;s top
50 universities in federal research funding and is ranked the fourth best U.S.
University under 50 years old by Times Higher Education. The Computer Science
Department is a leading department within the University. The Computer Science
Department has 24 tenure-track faculty members, and offers BS, MS and PhD
degrees. Our faculty includes two ACM Fellows and nine NSF CAREER award
recipients. We have annual research expenditures of $9.4M, primarily federally
funded. UIC is an excellent place for interdisciplinary research: UIC houses
the largest medical school in the country, and our faculty are engaged in many
cross-departmental collaborations with faculty from engineering, health
sciences, social sciences, urban planning, and the business school.

Chicago epitomizes the modern, livable, vibrant city. Located on the shore of
Lake Michigan, it offers an outstanding array of recreational and cultural
experiences. As the birthplace of the modern skyscraper, Chicago boasts one of
the world&rsquo;s tallest and densest skylines, combined with an extensive
system of parks and public transit. Yet the cost of living, whether in an 85th
floor condominium downtown or on a tree-lined street in one of the
nation&rsquo;s finest school districts, is surprisingly low.
*** Application Instructions ***
Applications must be submitted at https://jobs.uic.edu/. Please include a
resume, teaching and research statements, and names and addresses of at least
three references in the online application. Applicants needing additional
information may contact the Faculty Search Chair at search@cs.uic.edu. For
fullest consideration please apply by Nov. 25, 2013.

The University of Illinois at Chicago is an Affirmative Action/Equal
Opportunity Employer.
