This posting will expire on December 31, 2013.
Organization/Institution: Michigan Technological University
Department: Computer Science Department
Posted: October 10, 2013
Michigan Technological University invites applications and nominations for the
position of Chair of the Department of Computer Science to begin in the 2014-
2015 academic year. We seek an individual with the vision and leadership skills
to elevate the department&rsquo;s prominence in computer science research,
further our strong tradition of educational excellence, and grow our graduate
programs.
About the department: One of 10 departments in the College of Sciences and
Arts, the department has 18 faculty, including 14 full-time faculty (three of
whom have received NSF CAREER awards), two faculty with joint appointments, and
two lecturers. Faculty research interests include architecture, artificial
intelligence, compilers, distributed systems, embedded systems, graphics, human
computer interaction, machine learning, parallel computing, scientific
visualization, software engineering, and virtual environments. Faculty engage
in interdisciplinary research and collaborate with faculty in departments such
as Electrical and Computer Engineering, Civil and Environmental Engineering,
Cognitive and Learning Sciences, Humanities, Mathematical Sciences, Mechanical
Engineering, Physics, and the Schools of Technology and Forest Resources &amp;
Environmental Science. Major external research funding sources include NSF,
DoD, and NASA. Several faculty also collaborate with industrial partners and
have funding from Agere, AMD, Chrysler, and LSI.
The Computer Science Department has 350 undergraduate majors in three BS degree
programs, Computer Science, Computer Systems Science, and Software Engineering.
The department&rsquo;s graduate program currently has 12 MS and 25 PhD
students. The department plays an active role in the interdisciplinary
Computational Science and Engineering PhD program, which fosters research in
the application of computer science to engineering and scientific problems. The
department supports instruction in BS degree programs such as Computer
Engineering, Bioinformatics, Service Systems Engineering, Math-Business
Analytics, and Cheminformatics. The department has particularly close ties to
the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering in the College of
Engineering through joint appointments as well as significant faculty
participation by both departments in the activities of the Paul &amp; Susan
Williams Center for Computer Systems Research.
The department&rsquo;s specific goals include:
• increasing the quality, size, and stature of its graduate programs,
• increasing the stature of and funding for its research programs, especially
in terms of interdisciplinary opportunities,
• maintaining excellence in undergraduate education,
• attracting and retaining high quality and diverse students and faculty, and
• strengthening relationships with industry and alumni, as well as with other
academic units on campus.
Rekhi Hall houses the department&rsquo;s graduate student and faculty offices,
research and instructional labs, and classrooms. The faculty also have access
to a campus-wide high performance computing platform as well as
interdisciplinary research labs located in newly constructed Great Lakes
Research Center.
Qualifications: A candidate is expected to have a professional record of
accomplishments commensurate with the rank of full professor at Michigan Tech,
including an active research program, a record of funding, graduated PhD
students and high quality publications. A candidate must have demonstrated
administrative, supervisory, or leadership experience and have good
interpersonal skills. It is also desirable for the candidate to have experience
with faculty development.
About Michigan Tech: Michigan Tech is one of four major research universities
in the state. The University is located in Houghton near Lake Superior in
Michigan&rsquo;s scenic Upper Peninsula. The community offers four-season
recreational activities and world-class cultural events in a beautiful setting.
This environment, combined with a competitive compensation package, provides an
excellent quality of life.
The University has approximately 7,000 students and 412 faculty with
educational and research pro- grams that emphasize technological problems in
all aspects of life, ranging from traditional scientific and engineering
disciplines to Humanities and Fine Arts. In 2013, the University has been rated
one of the best Universities in Midwest for the third year in a row, according
to the Princeton Review. Michigan Tech is ranked 57th among national public
universities by the 2014 U.S. News &amp; World Report rankings. Michigan Tech
is named a Military Friendly School and Washington Monthly Magazine ranked
Michigan Tech 63rd overall, making Michigan Tech third among five Michigan
universities listed in the top 100.
Michigan Tech is an ADVANCE institution, one of a limited number of
universities in receipt of NSF funds in support of the University&rsquo;s
commitment to increase diversity and the participation and advancement of women
in STEM. Michigan Tech acknowledges the importance of supporting dual career
partners in attracting and retaining a quality workforce. Michigan Tech is
committed to offering career exploration advice and assistance whenever
feasible and appropriate at the University and in the local community. See
