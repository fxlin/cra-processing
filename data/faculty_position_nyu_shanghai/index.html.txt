**** Faculty Position ****
This posting will expire on December 31, 2013.
Organization/Institution: NYU SHANGHAI
Department: Computer Science
Posted: October 08, 2013
NYU Shanghai is currently inviting applications for one or two positions at all
levels (assistant, associate, and full professor) from outstanding candidates
having demonstrated abilities in both research and teaching. We are open to a
range of applicants, but will give special consideration to candidates in the
area of scalable distributed systems, especially those underlying large data
science projects whether in social media or the sciences. The ideal candidate
will have actively participated in and/or directed such a project in the past
that has already found practical application. When discussing their teaching
experience, candidates should identify courses they could teach both within and
outside their specialty.
Candidates must have completed a Ph.D. or equivalent by the time of
appointment. The search will remain open until the position is filled, but
review of applications will begin November 15, 2013. Appointments can begin as
soon as September 1, 2014, but candidates may elect to start as late as
September 1, 2015.
NYU Shanghai is the first Sino-US higher education joint venture to grant a
degree that is accredited in the US as well as in China. A research university
with liberal arts and sciences at its core, it resides in one of the world's
great cities, which is also a vibrant intellectual community (http://
shanghai.nyu.edu/). NYU Shanghai will recruit scholars who are committed to our
global vision of transformative teaching and innovative research.
New York University has established itself as a Global Network University, with
three degree-granting campuses - New York, Shanghai, and Abu Dhabi -
complemented by 12 additional academic centers across five continents. Faculty
and students circulate within the network in pursuit of common research
interests and cross-cultural, interdisciplinary endeavors, both local and
global.
The terms of employment in NYU Shanghai are comparable to U.S. institutions.
Faculty may also spend time at NYU New York and other sites of the global
network, engaging in both research and teaching opportunities.
 
*** Application Instructions ***
Applicants should submit curriculum vitae, a statement of research and teaching
interests, electronic copies of up to five recent relevant publications, and
three letters of reference in PDF format by November 15, 2013. Please visit our
website at http://shanghai.nyu.edu/about/open-positions-faculty for
instructions and other information on how to apply. If you have any questions,
please e-mail shanghai.faculty.recruitment@nyu.edu.
NYU Shanghai is an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Employer.
