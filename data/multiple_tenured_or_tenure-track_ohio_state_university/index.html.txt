cyberphysical systems, secure systems, data privacy, cryptography, or
programming language security.
•    One position (open rank) open to all areas of computer science and
engineering.
•    In addition, data analytics is slated for significant growth and we
anticipate open positions in data mining and cloud computing.

The department is committed to enhancing faculty diversity; women, minorities,
and individuals with disabilities are especially encouraged to apply.
