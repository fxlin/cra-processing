**** Teaching Track Positions ****
This posting will expire on December 31, 2013.
Organization/Institution: Carnegie Mellon University
Department: Computer Science Department
Posted: October 17, 2013
Applications are invited for two teaching-track positions in Computer Science,
beginning Fall 2014.  This is a renewable, career-oriented position with an
initial appointment for three years.  We seek highly qualified applicants with
a strong commitment to excellence in teaching and the ability to teach at all
levels in the undergraduate curriculum.

Applicants for the position must have a Ph.D. in Computer Science or a related
field, and demonstrated excellence in teaching Computer Science courses.
Teaching-track appointments are typically at the rank of Assistant Teaching
Professor, with the possibility of promotion to the ranks of Associate Teaching
Professor and Teaching Professor.  None of these ranks are tenured; applicants
seeking a tenure-track position at a research university are therefore not a
good match for these positions.

In order to receive full consideration, applicants should submit a letter of
application, curriculum vitae, a statement of teaching philosophy, and the
names and email addresses of three or more individuals whom the applicant has
asked to provide letters of reference.  Applicants should arrange for reference
letters to be sent directly to the contact below.  This information should be
sent by January 31, 2014, to the contact listed below.

Additionally, applicants are encouraged to submit a video sample of their
teaching, demonstrating their excellence.
*** Application Instructions ***
Please send your applications and accompanying materials to:

Dr. Klaus Sutner
Computer Science Department
Carnegie Mellon University
5000 Forbes Avenue
Pittsburgh, PA 15213
email: sutner@cs.cmu.edu

Carnegie Mellon is an affirmative action/equal opportunity employer and we
invite and encourage applications from women and under-represented minorities.
