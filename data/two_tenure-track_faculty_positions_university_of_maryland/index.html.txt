**** Two Tenure-Track Faculty Positions ****
This posting will expire on December 31, 2013.
Organization/Institution: University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC)
Department: Information Systems Department
Posted: October 16, 2013
The Information Systems Department at UMBC invites applications for two tenure-
track faculty positions at the Assistant Professor level starting August 2014. 
We are searching for candidates with research interests in any of the following
areas: Artificial Intelligence/Knowledge Management, Database/Data Mining,
Human Centered Computing, Software Engineering, and Health Information
Technology. Candidates must have earned a PhD in Information Systems or a
related field no later than August 2014.

Candidates should be engaged in research that spans two or more of these areas,
with one of those areas ideally being Health Information Technology. Preference
will be given to those who can collaborate with current faculty. Candidates for
both positions should have a strong potential for excellence in research, the
ability to develop and sustain an externally funded research program, and the
ability to contribute to our graduate and undergraduate teaching mission.

The Department offers undergraduate degrees in Information Systems and Business
Technology Administration. Graduate degree programs, MS and PhD, are offered in
both Information Systems and Human-Centered Computing, including an innovative
online MS in IS program. Consistent with the UMBC vision, the Department has
excellent teaching facilities, state-of-the-art laboratories, and outstanding
technical support. UMBC&rsquo;s Technology Center, Research Park, and Center
for Entrepreneurship are major indicators of active research and outreach.
Further details on our research, academic programs, and faculty can be found at
http://www.is.umbc.edu/. Members of under-represented groups including women
and minorities are especially encouraged to apply.
 
*** Application Instructions ***
Applications will not be reviewed until the following materials are received: a
cover letter, a one-page statement of teaching interests, a one to two-page
statement of research interests, one or more sample research papers, and a CV.
Applicants should also arrange to have three letters of recommendation sent to
the department as soon as possible. Electronic submission of materials as PDF
documents is preferred. Electronic copies should be sent to bmorris@umbc.edu.
Copies can also be sent to: Dr. Aryya Gangopadhyay, Chair of Faculty Search
Committee, Information Systems Department, UMBC, 1000 Hilltop Circle,
Baltimore, MD 21250-5398. For inquiries, please contact Barbara Morris at (410)
455-3795 or bmorris@umbc.edu.
