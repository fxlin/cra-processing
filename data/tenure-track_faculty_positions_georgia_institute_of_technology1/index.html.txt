Posted: October 10, 2013
The School of Computer Science in the College of Computing at the Georgia
Institute of Technology invites applications for tenure-track faculty
positions. We are primarily seeking junior-level candidates at the Assistant
Professor level. Truly exceptional candidates at the Associate and Full
Professor level may also be considered. Applicants should have completed or be
near completion of a Ph.D. in computer science or a related field and should
demonstrate potential for excellence in research and teaching. The School of
Computer Science, one of three schools in the College of Computing, focuses on
research that makes computing and communication smart, fast, reliable, and
secure, with research groups in computer architecture, databases, machine
learning, networking, programming languages, security, software engineering,
systems, and theory. We seek candidates that can add to or enhance the current
research areas of the school, with particular interest for candidates in the
systems area and candidates who bridge research areas.

Applications will be considered until open positions are filled. However, to
receive full consideration, applications should be submitted by December 9,
2013. Application materials should include a full academic CV, teaching and
