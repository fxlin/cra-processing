**** Tenure-track / Tenured Positions ****
This posting will expire on December 31, 2013.
Organization/Institution: Max Planck Institute for Software Systems
Posted: October 14, 2013
Applications are invited for tenure-track and tenured faculty positions in all
areas related to the study, design, and engineering of software systems. These
areas include, but are not limited to, security and privacy, embedded and
mobile systems, social computing, large-scale data management and machine
learning, programming languages and systems, software verification and
analysis, parallel and distributed systems, storage systems, and networking.

A doctoral degree in computer science or related areas and an outstanding
research record are required. Successful candidates are expected to build a
team and pursue a highly visible research agenda, both independently and in
collaboration with other groups. Senior candidates must have demonstrated
leadership abilities and recognized international stature.

MPI-SWS, founded in 2005, is part of a network of eighty Max Planck Institutes,
Germany's premier basic research facilities. MPIs have an established record of
world-class, foundational research in the fields of medicine, biology,
chemistry, physics, technology and humanities. Since 1948, MPI researchers have
won 17 Nobel prizes. MPI-SWS aspires to meet the highest standards of
excellence and international recognition with its research in software systems.

To this end, the institute offers a unique environment that combines the best
aspects of a university department and a research laboratory:
a) Faculty receive generous base funding to build and lead a team of graduate
students and post-docs. They have full academic freedom and publish their
research results freely.
b) Faculty supervise doctoral theses, and have the opportunity to teach
graduate and undergraduate courses.
c) Faculty are provided with outstanding technical and administrative support
facilities as well as internationally competitive compensation packages.

MPI-SWS currently has 10 tenured and tenure-track faculty and 40 doctoral and
post-doctoral researchers. The institute is funded to support 17 faculty and up
to 100 doctoral and post-doctoral positions. Additional growth through outside
funding is possible. We maintain an open, international and diverse work
environment and seek applications from outstanding researchers regardless of
national origin or citizenship. The working language is English; knowledge of
the German language is not required for a successful career at the institute.
The institute is located in Kaiserslautern and Saarbruecken, in the tri-border
area of Germany, France and Luxembourg. The area offers a high standard of
living, beautiful surroundings and easy access to major metropolitan areas in
the center of Europe, as well as a stimulating, competitive and collaborative
work environment. In immediate proximity are the MPI for Informatics, Saarland
University, the Technical University of Kaiserslautern, the German Center for
Artificial Intelligence (DFKI), and the Fraunhofer Institutes for Experimental
Software Engineering and for Industrial Mathematics.
*** Application Instructions ***
Qualified candidates should apply online at https://apply.mpi-sws.org The
review of applications will begin on December 15, 2013, and applicants are
strongly encouraged to apply by that date; however, applications will continue
to be accepted through January 2014.

The institute is committed to increasing the representation of minorities,
women and individuals with physical disabilities in Computer Science. We
particularly encourage such individuals to apply. You can find more information
