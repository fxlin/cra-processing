**** Three Tenure-Track Faculty Positions ****
This posting will expire on December 31, 2013.
Organization/Institution: Northeastern University Boston, Massachusetts
Department: College of Computer and Information Science
Posted: October 15, 2013
The College of Computer and Information Science invites applications for at
least three tenure-track faculty positions, beginning in Fall 2014.  Applicants
at all ranks will be considered. A PhD in Computer Science, Information Science
or a related field by the start date is required.

Candidates will be considered from all areas in Computer and Information
Science. We particularly welcome candidates with research interests in data-
intensive computing (e.g., machine learning, databases, and data mining),
graphics, security, and software engineering. Candidates are expected to have
or to develop an independently funded research program of international caliber
and participate in undergraduate and graduate teaching.

The College maintains a strong research program with significant funding from
major federal research agencies and private industry and was instrumental in
Northeastern being recognized by NSA/DHS as a center of excellence for research
and education in Information Assurance.

The College has a diverse full-time faculty of 44, and offers a broad array of
educational opportunities to students.  Since 2010, the College has hired 23
outstanding faculty members, and plans to continue this strategic growth in the
coming years.  In addition to Bachelor&rsquo;s, Master&rsquo;s, and PhD
programs in the computing discipline, the College offers several innovative
undergraduate and graduate degree programs that combine computing with an
important application domain. Eleven faculty members have joint appointments
with other academic departments, including Electrical and Computer Engineering,
Art and Design, Health Sciences, Physics, and Political Science.  The College
has 685 undergraduates, 759 Masters, and 108 Ph.D. students.

Northeastern University is home to 20,000 students and to the nation's premier
cooperative education program.  The past decade has witnessed a dramatic
increase in Northeastern's international reputation for research and innovative
educational programs.  A heightened focus on interdisciplinary research and
scholarship is driving a faculty hiring initiative at Northeastern, advancing
its position amongst the nation's top research universities.  The College has
been a major participant in this initiative and will continue the efforts this
year, with additional interdisciplinary searches ongoing in related areas.  For
more information about the College, please visit http://www.ccs.neu.edu. 
Northeastern University is located on the Avenue of the Arts in Boston's
historic Back Bay. The College occupies a state of the art building opposite
Boston's Museum of Fine Arts.
