graduate, and doctoral students and more than 13,500 faculty and staff. The
University is a member of the prestigious Association of American Universities
and co-manager of nearby Brookhaven National Laboratory, a multidisciplinary
research laboratory supporting world class scientific programs utilizing state-
of-the-art facilities. Stony Brook Medicine is Suffolk County's only academic
medical center and tertiary care provider. Many opportunities exist for
collaborative research, and in some cases, joint appointments with BNL or with
Medical School departments.

computation with the intent of creating a vibrant multi-disciplinary program.
IACS seeks to make sustained advances in the fundamental techniques of
computation and in high-impact applications including engineering and the
physical, life, and social sciences. Our integrated, multidisciplinary team of
faculty, students, and staff overcome the limitations at the very core of how
we compute, collectively take on challenges of otherwise overwhelming
complexity and scale, and individually and jointly define new frontiers and
opportunities for discovery through computation. In coordination with the
Center for Scientific Computing at Brookhaven National Laboratory, our dynamic
and diverse institute serves as an ideal training and proving ground for new
generations of students and researchers, and provides computational leadership
and resources across the SBU campus and state of New York. The selected
