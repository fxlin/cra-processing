**** Faculty Positions in Data Science ****
This posting will expire on January 31, 2014.
Organization/Institution: Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia
Posted: November 06, 2013
Emory University Math &amp; Computer Science is leading an initiative in Data
Scienceto pioneer research and educational advances in this emerging
multidisciplinary domain. This initiative builds upon current strengths in
data-oriented topics within Computer Science and connects to new areas of
emphasis across the life and social sciences at Emory. We intend to recruit a
cluster of six or more outstanding scholars in complementary areas of Data
Science over the next few years.

Applications for Tenure-Track Positions at the Assistant Professor level are
invited from exceptional candidates with outstanding research and teaching
records (or promise) in fields related to Data Science. Truly eminent
candidates may be considered for appointment at higher ranks, subject to
administrative approval. Specific priority areas for this year&rsquo;s searches
are:

Data Management and Database Systems &ndash; Applicants must have a PhD in
Computer Science or a closely related area, with specialization in databases,
data and information management, data analysis, storage systems or related
topics. The successful candidate will join a growing niche-excellent program in
Computer Science within the Mathematics &amp; Computer Science department
(http://www.mathcs.emory.edu) and contribute to core scholarship and teaching
at the undergraduate and graduate levels.

Natural Language Processing&ndash; All areas related to NLP are of interest,
including computational linguistics, language understanding, information
extraction, machine translation, and sentiment analysis. Based in Mathematics
&amp; Computer Science (http://www.mathcs.emory.edu), this position will have a
formal role and teaching responsibilities in the Institute for Quantitative
Theory and Methods (http://quantitative.emory.edu), as well as a possible
affiliation with the Linguistics program. A PhD in Computer Science or closely
related field is required, as is an interest in interdisciplinary
collaborations, particularly with the social sciences and humanities.

Machine Learning with Applications to Life Science Informatics &ndash; In
partnership with Emory&rsquo;s strategic initiative in Computational Life
Sciences, we seek an exceptional Machine Learning scholar, interested in
applications to life sciences and medical informatics. Candidates must have a
PhD in Computer Science, Informatics or Statistics. Primary appointment will be
in Mathematics &amp; Computer Science (http://www.mathcs.emory.edu); with
possible secondary or courtesy appointments in Biomedical Informatics (http://
www.bmi.emory.edu/) or in Biostatistics and Bionformatics (http://
www.sph.emory.edu/departments_centers/bios/index.html).
*** Application Instructions ***
Applications specifying one or more of the above areas and comprising a CV,
research and teaching statements, and three to five letters of recommendation
directly from recommenders, should be sent via email to
cssearch2014@mathcs.emory.edu. Informal inquiries are also invited by email.
Screening starts January 6, 2014 and will continue until all positions are
