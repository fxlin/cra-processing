**** Faculty Position ****
This posting will expire on December 31, 2013.
Organization/Institution: University College London (UCL)
Department: Department of Computer Science
Posted: October 16, 2013
The Department of Computer Science at University College London (UCL) invites
applications for a faculty position in the areas of Computer Systems and
Networking. We seek world-class talent; candidates must have an outstanding
research track record.

Areas of interest for this position include operating systems, systems
security, distributed systems, networking, and their intersection, with an
emphasis on experimental system-building. Appointments will be made at the rank
of Lecturer, Senior Lecturer, or Reader (equivalent to Assistant Professor,
junior Associate Professor, and senior Associate Professor, respectively, in
the US system), commensurate with qualifications.

Candidates must hold an earned Ph.D. in Computer Science or a closely related
field by the time they begin their appointment. They will be evaluated chiefly
on the significance and novelty of their research to date, and their promise
for leading a group in a fruitful program of research. They must also
demonstrate a zest for innovative and challenging teaching at the graduate and
undergraduate levels. A proven record of ability to manage time and evidence of
ability to teach and to supervise academic work by undergraduates, masters, and
doctoral students are desirable. Our department is a highly collaborative
environment, and we seek future colleagues who enjoy working collaboratively.
Candidates should further be committed to public communication, and to UCL's
policy of equal opportunity, including working harmoniously with colleagues and
students of all cultures and backgrounds.

Since 1973, when UCL CS became the first ARPAnet node outside the United
States, the department has been a leading centre for networking research, as
demonstrated by its long-standing strong presence in the SIGCOMM conference
proceedings.

UCL, the third oldest university in England, and the first to admit students
without regard for their race or creed, sits a few blocks from the British
Museum in central London, a vibrant metropolis of 8.3 million that offers an
ever-renewing panoply of cultural and culinary choices, and is a budget airfare
away from all of continental Europe.

 
*** Application Instructions ***
Further details about UCL CS, the posts, and how to apply may be found at http:
//www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/vacancies

All application materials must reach UCL by the 17th of January, 2014.

We particularly welcome female applicants and those from an ethnic minority, as
they are under-represented within UCL at these levels.
