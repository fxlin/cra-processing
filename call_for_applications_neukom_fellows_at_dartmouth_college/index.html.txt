Organization/Institution: Neukom Fellows at Dartmouth College
Department: The Neukom Institute for Computational Science at Dartmouth
Posted: October 17, 2013
College is pleased to announce the 2013 Neukom Fellows competition. Neukom
Fellows are interdisciplinary positions for recent Ph.D.s, DMAs, or MFAs whose
research interests or practice cuts across traditional disciplinary boundaries,
but has some computational component, whether it be a framing concept for
intellectual exploration or an explicit component of the work that is pursued.
The successful candidate should have a history of collaborative work across
disciplines, but still show good evidence of independence and initiative. The
Fellowships are two- to three-year appointments, with the third year extension
considered upon request after a review early in the second year.  Neukom
Fellows will be mentored by faculty in two departments at Dartmouth College,
take up residence in one department, and will teach one seminar course each
year on a subject of their interest. Beyond that there are no additional
duties. Neukom Fellow stipends are $60,000 for 2014-2015. Additional funds are
available for equipment, travel, and research materials.

Requirements:
1. Ph.D. in any discipline or DMA or MFA (or expected by September 2014). 2.
Research interests that strongly intersect the theme of computation. 3. A
proven ability to work independently and collaboratively 4. A demonstrated
interest in multidisciplinary research. 5. Evidence of the ability to think
outside traditional paradigms.

 
*** Application Instructions ***
Application Materials:
Interested candidates are strongly encouraged to contact prospective mentors at
Dartmouth College and must submit the following materials:

1) Curriculum vitae (including publications list).
2) Statement of research interests (max. 2 pages) including a short description
of the research you would like to pursue and why.
3) Description of which departments (and even better, which Dartmouth faculty)
you would be interested in working with and why the opportunity to engage with
multiple departments would enhance your work.
4) Three referees whose letters of recommendation speak to the aims of the
Fellowship.
5) (Optional) A copy of one paper you have written in English, either published
or unpublished.

Apply at: https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/jobs/3364

Completed applications received by December 1, 2013 will receive first
consideration. Materials received after that date or those that do not fulfill
the above requirements stand the chance of not being considered. Applications
from women and minorities are encouraged. Dartmouth College is an equal
opportunity employer.
